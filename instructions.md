## Instructions for working with Github.

### git clone
**git clone** is used for copying the already ready file / folder in github.com from different account to our own local folder. 
in order to copy the file / folder we need to copy the link of the file / folder and the apply **git clone** in VS and put this link after the command.
 
### git push
once you have copied / cloned the file / folder from the github into your own local folder, you can start working further by creatingg different branch. once you have finished the works with this branch, we can apply **git push** command which will enable to reflect this change in intitial origin account's folder. once we have done this command, we need to update the folder in github and we will see that there will appear the change also a new line in green backrgound asking for a __*pull request*__. Once we press this button the intiial originator will be able to see the change you have made in your local folder.

### git pull
this command is applied when we want to copy the change in guthub folder (which is remote) which hasnt been there before to our local folder.

### fork (on github.com)
this is for basically copying the folder of someone's account to our own folder in github and continue working on our own further on.
